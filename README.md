Using Python and language processing to extract summary and accession numbers from journal papers. These notebooks process and extract parts of pdf documents relevant for text analysis.

1. Extract_NCBI_AccessionNums.ipynb : extracts NCBI accession numbers from journal papers. Accession numbers are used to retrieve sequences from SRA database.
2. ScalpingPDF.ipynb : extracts the text from the first page of pdf documents. The first page of any journal paper usually contains the abstract and keywords, as well as author information.
3. SubtopicDiscovery.ipynb : calculates top key words. (Not very useful but it was something used for a small project).
